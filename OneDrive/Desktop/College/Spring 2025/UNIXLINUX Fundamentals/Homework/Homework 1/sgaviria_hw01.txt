github.com/Sgavir8738/.dotfiles

Completing the homework was easy by following the instructions of the pdf.
However, commiting to the repository did not work immediately because I configured the username incorrectly.
Once I reconfigured the username to be the same as my github profile, the operation was completed sucessfully

cd
mkdir .dotfiles
ls
cd .dotfiles
pwd
nano README.md
cat README.md
nano .nanorc
mv .nanorc ../
git init
git add --all
git commit -m "INIT commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:sgavir8738/.dotfiles
git push -u origin main
